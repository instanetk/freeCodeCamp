        <h1>Introduction to the Functional Programming Challenges</h1>
        <p>Functional programming is an approach to software development based around the evaluation of functions. Like mathematics, functions in programming map input to output to produce a result. You can combine basic functions in many ways to build more and more complex programs.<br><br>Functional programming follows a few core principles:<br><br></p><ul><li>Functions are independent from the state of the program or global variables. They only depend on the arguments passed into them to make a calculation</li><br><li>Functions try to limit any changes to the state of the program and avoid changes to the global objects holding data</li><br><li>Functions have minimal side effects in the program</li></ul><br><br>The functional programming software development approach breaks a program into small, testable parts. This section covers basic functional programming principles in JavaScript.
