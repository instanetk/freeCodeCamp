  <h1>Introduction to Basic Algorithm Scripting</h1>
  <p>A computer algorithm is a sequence of steps that is followed to achieve a particular outcome. To write an algorithm, you must first understand a problem, and then solve it with coding.</p>
  <p>To make solving problems easier, it can be helpful to break them down into many chunks. Then, each chunk can be solved one by one. For example, if you are building a calculator, don't try to solve the problem as a whole. First, consider how
    to get inputs. Then, determine each arithmetic operation one by one. Finally, display the results.</p>
  <p>In this section we will learn to solve basic algorithm problems using JavaScript. This will help you improve your problem solving skills and prepare you to later solve more complex problems.</p>
